# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

TODO
1) create a launcher app in android. I want to create android launcher that launches some favorited apps based on gestures. idealy I'd also like to create a way for the user to set the favorite apps as well as create an app drawer. in a perfect world the user would also be able to uninstall apps.

2) make a device that reminds me to water my plants by displaying pixel art of them on an led matrix. either use hardware inputs with an arduino to snooze reminders, or create a web interface with a server running on a raspberry pi. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I don't plan to work with anyone.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I have experience with raspberry pis and creating web servers. Would it be better to try something I haven't done before? Or work on something I'm confident I can get done.
